- I am Sasha Tanase, Head of Design at Alethio, the Ethereum Data Analytics Platform. I come from a background in Architecture and has applied my user-centric design passion to a career in advertising, working for companies such as DDB, McCann and Jung von Matt. My innovative advertising designs have won me multiple awards. Now I apply my understanding of consumer behaviour and architectural design to help create brilliant user experiences for Alethio, which is a ConsenSys spoke. Always with one eye on the end-user, I am dedicated to interrogating biases and using qualitative user research to inform my design decisions. I am never afraid of failing because as I say **" failing is an evolutionary tool "**.
